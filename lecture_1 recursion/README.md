## Lecture - 1

This lecture was based on **Recursion**. *Recursion* basically means breaking a complex problem into simpler sub-problems whose solution we can compute easily that eventually helps us to get the solution of our original complex problem.

### For Example,

1. Suppose, our problem is to find factorial of 5
2. 5! can be broken down into 5 * 4!
3. further, 4! can be broken down into 4 * 3! and so on until we reach 0! whose factorial we know is 1 and hence we using this solution we can solve the 5! by going one step back.
